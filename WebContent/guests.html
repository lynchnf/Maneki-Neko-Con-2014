                <h2>Animation GOH</h2>
                <img class="image-left" src="assets/images/doug-ricejpg.png" alt="Doug Rice">
                <p>
                    <strong>Douglas E. Rice</strong> is a comic-book artist, writer and television animator living in the Chicago area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doug Rice is just like any other ordinary, funny-loving, sushi-slopping, comic-book scribbling, clean-shaven, silver-haired, Emmy Award winning, 61 year-old Viet Nam vet... a dime a dozen. Doug entered numerous art shows at Sci-Fi conventions, starting with a convention right here in IL. Doug created the SF comic-series DYNAMO JOE, worked for all the major US comic publishers, and later earned an Emmy certificate for his work in TV animation (&quot; <em>Steven Spielberg presents The Animaniacs</em> &quot;, &quot; <em>Pinky &amp; The Brain</em> &quot;). DYNAMO JOE is being re-mastered and re-printed and Doug's first novel, SQUADRON, which will be released later this year.
                </p>
                <p>Working on-staff with First Comics in 1982, Doug was given the opportunity to create an 8-page back-up series for the monthly title, MARS. With the guidance of John Ostrander, Rice created the first original giant-robot series in America back in 1984, DYNAMO JOE. The back-up series continued in FIRST ADVENTURES, then under its own banner, DYNAMO JOE, lasting 15 issues (with a cross-over/one-shot in GRIM-JACK). John Ostrander adapted the material to scripts for the first-run, with Phil Foglio picking up the scripting chores for the bulk of the series thereafter.</p>
                <p>Rice would go on to draw and co-write (w/ Phil Foglio) the initial STARBLAZERS mini-series for Comico, then move on to DC Comics to contribute layouts and gags to the Foglio/Barta PLASTIC-MAN mini-series, then doing art for the John Ostrander/Kim Yale version of MANHUNTER in 1988. Rice followed up by teaming with Hilary Barta on several short humor-based super-hero parodies for Marvel's WHAT THE--?! (as co-writer and one-time artist) and TOXIC AVENGER (as co-writer). His next significant work was for Disney Comics, doing monthly 8-page ROGER RABBIT/MICKEY MOUSE fillers until all new material on old characters was cancelled. In 1994, Doug moved into the field of TV-animation, working for a small Chicago-area animation studio, Startoons, doing work for Warner Brothers.</p>
