                <p>We are excited to give students and professionals the chance to show off their talent and sell their work. You may enter art for our contest; list it for sale, or both. There is no current limit on the numbers of entries you can submit, however if we do fill up the whole art show, we may institute a limit to be fair in showing as many artists as possible.</p>
                </p>
                <h3>Content Guidelines</h3>
                <p>
                    Artwork submitted should be anime, sci-fi, furry, or fantasy themed. We ask that there be no excessive gore or violence, no nudity, and no vulgar language. In short, try to keep everything family friendly. If you have any questions about the content of your art then feel free to email us at<a href="mailto:art@maneki-neko-con.org"> art&nbsp;@&nbsp;maneki-neko-con.org</a>
                </p>
                We reserve the right to refuse to hang any art that we think does not meet the above requirements. If we refuse to hang your art, we will refund your hanging fee for that art.
                <h3>Awards</h3>
                <p>There will be five awards given out for artwork:</p>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Best Junior Artist, Junior High School Students</li>
                    <li>Best Young Artist, High School Students</li>
                    <li>Best Young Adult Artist, College Students (maximum age 24)</li>
                    <li>Best in Show (all ages including professional)</li>
                    <li>Best '3-d' entry<sup>*</sup> (see aside for detail)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <aside class="ui basic segment">
                    <p>* Aside from the content guidelines above, artwork entered in this competition should have a '3-D' theme; meaning the art doesn't necessarily have to be 3d art but should demonstrate the concept of depth and perspective. Good Luck!</p>
                </aside>
                <h3>Fees &amp; Profits</h3>
                <p>There is a hanging fee for all art in the show. Pictures to be sold for up to $99 will be $0.50 each to hang. Pictures that are for sale for $100 or more, or not for sale (NFS), will cost $1.00 each to hang. In addition, any art that we sell for you will be subject to a 10% commission based off of the sale price. If you have any profits from the show, we will mail a check out to you once we have processed the receipts.</p>
                <h3>Print Shop</h3>
                <p>We will have limited space for prints. Items must conform to all above content requirements and be a print (not original). We reserve the right to display them in any fashion that is accessible to the attendees; however, we do not guarantee that your items will have wall space. These items in the print shop will NOT be judged in the art contest; however, if the original is in the show, we will judge the original. Items in print shop may have multiple copies. We will not charge a hanging fee for these items, only the 10% commission on any item that sells. If your item does not sell, there is no cost to you except for any cost associated with mail-in and/or hand delivery (see below).</p>
                <h3>Charity Auction</h3>
